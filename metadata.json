    "Description": "Prediction of the antimalarial potential of small molecules. This model was originally trained on proprietary data from various sources, up to a total of >7M compounds. The training sets belong to Evotec, Johns Hopkins, MRCT, MMV - St. Jude, AZ, GSK, and St. Jude Vendor Library. In this implementation, we have used a teacher-student approach to train a surrogate model based on ChEMBL data (2M molecules) to provide a lite downloadable version of the original MAIP",
